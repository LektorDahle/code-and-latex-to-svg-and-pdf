# code-and-latex-to-svg-and-pdf
A lightweight code and LaTeX compiler that generates PDF and SVG outputs with syntax highlighting. The goal is to provide functionality missing in tools like Affinity Publisher (PDF export) and Inkscape (SVG export), making it easier to create high-quality, highlighted code snippets for professional documents and graphics.
